# ProxyDDoS Tool

ProxyDDoS is an educational tool designed for stress-testing and simulating real-world DDoS attacks using proxies. It leverages HTTP GET floods routed through SOCKS/HTTP proxies to test server resilience, load balancing, and firewall protection.

> ❗ **DISCLAIMER:** This tool is strictly for **educational**, **research**, and **authorized testing** purposes. Do not use this against servers you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Infinite request flooding via proxy rotation
- 🔗 HTTP GET flood using raw sockets
- 🌐 Full proxy support (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4/5)
- 🔍 Real-time request logging
- 🧠 Multi-threaded high-speed requests
- 🎨 Stylish terminal UI with animated startup

## 🧠 How It Works

The tool establishes a `CONNECT` tunnel via each proxy to the target host, then sends repeated `GET` requests through that tunnel. This simulates legitimate web traffic, bypassing some weak DDoS protections.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `pystyle` (for UI effects)

### Install dependencies:

pip install pystyle

# ⚙️ Usage
Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/Threadlinee/ProxyDDoS.git
cd ProxyDDoS
then
Run the script:
python ddos-508.py

python ddos-508.py
Input the target URL (example: http://example.com)

# ℹ️ The attack will run infinitely until you stop the script manually (Ctrl+C).
